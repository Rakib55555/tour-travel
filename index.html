        <h2>What do I love about traveling?</h2>
        <p>For the first time in this year of wild adventures I am actually trying to find some answers to the above question, firstly because my editor (hey Mandy!) asked me to do so (thank you, Sabrina :P), secondly because it might help me reply to the thousands of questions I have in my mind and to the people who keep asking this question over and over. Truth to be told, I have no plans or plane tickets to go home yet and the more I see, the more I want to see. Yeah, it’s like a drug, but the good kind (and totally legal). After much reflection, here is a first list…but I feel that in a few months, the reasons might change.</p>

            <h1 class="div2">Experiencing New Cultures</h1>
            <h2>I love experiencing new cultures</h2>
            <p>This is probably the most common reason. I don’t travel to tick boxes on an imaginary list of countries (nor I count them if I only have a flight connection there, as some other bloggers do…..). Immersing myself in a new culture is the “why” I keep traveling without getting bored or tired. I love understanding new people, culture and history behind the country or a city.</p>

                <h1>I love learning</h1>
                <p>Learning is a strong reason why people travel. They want to experience something unfamiliar and leave with new skills or knowledge. Seeing the world is more educational than a high school or college class. This real-life course of discovering how the rest of the world lives covers subjects you might have hated at school, but you will love now. And because you’re actually experiencing this learning in real life, not reading it in a textbook, it will stay with you for a long time. In fact, it will stay with you, forever.</p>

                    <h1>I love meeting new people</h1>
                    <p>Since I have started traveling and forced by the situations, I found my old self somewhere inside me. I remember the young Sabrina – social and not afraid to chat to people. It took some time to dig her out and convince her to come out of the shyness closet. She was covered by layers of corporate life, but at some point she did and we are now inseparable. (It’s me, in case you didn’t get it) I’ve managed to make some great friends and some of my fondest memories of travel have been moments with the people that I met on the road.</p>
